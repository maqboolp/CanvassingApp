# Database Connection Pool Exhaustion - Fixes Applied

## Issues Found
1. **Connection Pool Exhaustion**: PostgreSQL error "remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute"
2. **Missing Connection Pooling Configuration**: Connection string lacked proper pooling parameters
3. **Long-Running Database Contexts**: Background services keeping connections open for extended periods
4. **Insufficient Error Handling**: Database connection errors not properly handled

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Connection Pooling Configuration (Program.cs)
Added connection pooling parameters to the connection string:
- `Pooling=true`: Enables connection pooling
- `Maximum Pool Size=20`: Limits max connections per pool
- `Minimum Pool Size=5`: Maintains minimum idle connections
- `Connection Lifetime=300`: Recycles connections after 5 minutes
- `Connection Idle Lifetime=60`: Closes idle connections after 1 minute
- `Timeout=30`: Sets command timeout to 30 seconds

### 2. Resilience Settings
Added retry logic for transient failures:
- Max retry count: 3
- Max retry delay: 5 seconds
- Command timeout: 30 seconds

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling (GlobalExceptionMiddleware.cs)
Added specific handlers for:
- PostgreSQL connection exhaustion (error 53300)
- Transient database failures
- Better error messages for users

### 4. Database Health Check Service
Created `DatabaseHealthCheckService.cs` to:
- Monitor connection pool usage
- Provide health check endpoint at `/api/health`
- Alert when connection usage is high (>75%)

### 5. Background Service Monitoring
Created `BackgroundServiceMonitor.cs` to:
- Track long-running operations
- Identify operations that may be holding connections
- Provide admin endpoint at `/api/admin/background-operations`

## Recommendations

### 1. Database Connection Limits
- Check your DigitalOcean database connection limit
- Consider upgrading if you need more connections
- Current configuration allows max 20 connections per app instance

### 2. Code Review Areas
- **CampaignService**: Long-running operations with delays may hold connections
- **AudioCleanupService**: Runs daily but keeps connection for entire operation
- Consider using shorter-lived contexts for batch operations

### 3. Monitoring
- Use `/api/health` endpoint to monitor database connection health
- Set up alerts for connection pool exhaustion
- Monitor `/api/admin/background-operations` for stuck operations

### 4. Best Practices
- Always use `using` statements or proper disposal for DbContext
- Avoid keeping DbContext instances alive for long operations
- For batch operations, consider creating new contexts for each batch
- Use `AsNoTracking()` for read-only queries to reduce memory usage

## Testing the Fixes
1. Monitor the application logs for connection pool statistics
2. Check health endpoint: `GET /api/health`
3. Load test the application to verify connection pooling works
4. Monitor PostgreSQL connection count: 
   ```sql
   SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname = 't4h';
   ```

## Refactored Services

### CampaignService Refactoring
- **Split long-running operations into smaller scoped operations**
- **Release database connections between batches**
- **Each batch gets its own database context**
- **Added background operation monitoring**
- **Separate methods for each batch to ensure proper disposal**

Key changes:
```csharp
// Old: Single long-lived context
using var scope = _serviceScopeFactory.CreateScope();
// Process all batches with same context

// New: Multiple short-lived contexts
foreach(batch) {
    using var scope = _serviceScopeFactory.CreateScope();
    // Process one batch
    // Context disposed after each batch
}
```

### AudioCleanupService Refactoring
- **Process deletions in batches of 50 items**
- **Create new context for each batch**
- **Add delays between batches to reduce load**
- **Store only IDs in memory, not full entities**

## Future Improvements
1. Implement circuit breaker pattern for database operations
2. Add connection pool metrics to application insights/monitoring
3. Consider implementing read replicas for heavy read operations
4. Move to queue-based processing for campaigns
5. Implement connection pool warming on startup
